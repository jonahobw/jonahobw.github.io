ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website!

Iâ€™m a software engineer at Mathworks, working on image processing, computer vision, and automated visual inspection.

I contribute to a team focused on solving challenging problems at the intersection of AI and industrial manufacturing. My work involves building tools to automate and improve quality control through anomaly detection. These solutions have potential applications in areas like medical imaging and predictive maintenance.

As a scientist, Iâ€™m broadly interested in the theoretical foundations and practical applications of core deep learning areas like computer vision, generative models, and adversarial machine learning.

Previously, I completed my Master's in Computer Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I was advised by Sandip Kundu and worked on adversarial attacks and defenses to deep neural networks. I have also brought robots to life at Amazon Robotics (2022), wrangled big data at Tesla (2021), and prevented supply chain attacks at Dell (2020).

Outside of work, I like to balance my technical pursuits by staying active (soccer, gym, running), expressing creativity through drumming ([@jonahobwdrums](https://www.instagram.com/jonahobwdrums/)),  exploring a wide range of topics through reading, (philosophy, psychology, economics, social issues), and recharging with good food and good company.
